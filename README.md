# OpenID for node.js

OpenID for node.js is (yes, you guessed it) an OpenID implementation for node.js. 

Highlights and features include:

- Full OpenID 1.0/1.1/2.0 compliant Relying Party (client) implementation
- Very simple API
- Simple extension points for association state

## Download

The library can be [reviewed and retrieved from GitHub](http://github.com/havard/node-openid).

## Installation

If you use [`npm`](http://npmjs.org), simply do `npm install openid`.

Otherwise, you can grab the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/havard/node-openid) 
and 

## Examples

Instead of walking through step-by-step, here's a very simple server 
using OpenID for node.js for authentication:

```javascript
var openid = require('openid');
var url = require('url');
var querystring = require('querystring');
var relyingParty = new openid.RelyingParty(
    'http://example.com/verify', // Verification URL (yours)
    null, // Realm (optional, specifies realm for OpenID authentication)
    false, // Use stateless verification
    false, // Strict mode
    []); // List of extensions to enable and include


var server = require('http').createServer(
    function(req, res)
    {
        var parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url);
        if(parsedUrl.pathname == '/authenticate')
        { 
          // User supplied identifier
          var query = querystring.parse(parsedUrl.query);
          var identifier = query.openid_identifier;

          // Resolve identifier, associate, and build authentication URL
          relyingParty.authenticate(identifier, false, function(error, authUrl)
              {
                if (error)
                {
                  res.writeHead(200);
                  res.end('Authentication failed: ' + error.message);
                }
                else if (!authUrl)
                {
                  res.writeHead(200);
                  res.end('Authentication failed');
                }
                else
                {
                  res.writeHead(302, { Location: authUrl });
                  res.end();
                }
              });
        }
        else if(parsedUrl.pathname == '/verify')
        {
            // Verify identity assertion
            // NOTE: Passing just the URL is also possible
            relyingParty.verifyAssertion(req, function(error, result)
            {
              res.writeHead(200);
              res.end(!error && result.authenticated 
                  ? 'Success :)'
                  : 'Failure :(');
            });
        }
        else
        {
            // Deliver an OpenID form on all other URLs
            res.writeHead(200);
            res.end('<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>'
                + '<form method="get" action="/authenticate">'
                + '<p>Login using OpenID</p>'
                + '<input name="openid_identifier" />'
                + '<input type="submit" value="Login" />'
                + '</form></body></html>');
        }
    });
server.listen(80);
```

A more elaborate example including utilizing extensions can be found in `sample.js` in the GitHub repository.

## Supported Extensions
This library comes with built-in support for the following OpenID extensions:

 - The Simple Registration (SREG) 1.1 extension is implemented as `openid.SimpleRegistration`
 - The Attribute Exchange (AX) 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.AttributeExchange`
 - The OAuth 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.OAuthHybrid`
 - The User Interface 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.UserInterface`
 - The Provider Authentication Policy Extension 1.0 (PAPE) as `openid.pape`

## Storing association state

To provide a way to save/load association state, you need to mix-in two functions in
the `openid` module:

 - `saveAssociation(provider, type, handle, secret, expiry_time_in_seconds, callback)` is called when a new association is established during authentication. The callback should be called with any error as its first argument (or `null` if no error occured).
 - `loadAssociation(handle, callback)` is used to retrieve the association identified by `handle` when verification happens. The callback should be called with any error as its first argument (and `null` as the second argument), or an object with the keys `provider`, `type`, `secret` if the association was loaded successfully.

The `openid` module includes default implementations for these functions using a simple object to store the associations in-memory.

## Caching discovered information

The verification of a positive assertion (i.e. an authenticated user) can be sped up significantly by avoiding the need for additional provider discoveries when possible. In order to achieve, this speed-up, node-openid needs to cache its discovered providers. You can mix-in two functions to override the default cache, which is an in-memory cache utilizing a simple object store:
  
  - `saveDiscoveredInformation(key, provider, callback)` is used when saving a discovered provider.  The following behavior is required:
    - The `key` parameter should be uses as a key for storing the provider - it will be used as the lookup key when loading the provider. (Currently, the key is either a claimed identifier or an OP-local identifier, depending on the OpenID context.)
    - When saving fails for some reason, `callback(error)` is called with `error` being an error object specifying what failed.
    - When saving succeeds, `callback(null)` is called.

  - `loadDiscoveredInformation(key, callback)` is used to load any previously discovered information about the provider for an identifier. The following behavior is required:    
      - When no provider is found for the identifier, `callback(null, null)` is called (i.e. it is not an error to not have any data to return).
      - When loading fails for some reason, `callback(error, null)` is called with `error` being an error string specifying why loading failed.
      - When loading succeeds, `callback(null, provider)` is called with the exact provider object that was previously stored using `saveDiscoveredInformation`.

## Proxy Support
`node-openid` makes HTTP and HTTPS requests during authentication. You can have these
requests go through a proxy server, by using the following environment variables:

 - HTTP_PROXY_HOST and HTTP_PROXY_PORT control how http:// requests are sent
 - HTTPS_PROXY_HOST and HTTPS_PROXY_PORT control how https:// requests are sent
